# 🧁 Bakery Sales Performance Dashboard

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of real-world transactional data from **The Bread Basket**, a bakery in Edinburgh. The objective was to understand customer behavior, identify sales trends, and provide actionable business recommendations using a combination of Python, Excel, and Power BI.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Leverage transaction data to:
- Identify top-performing products and time slots
- Uncover seasonality and peak sales patterns
- Recommend inventory and promotional strategies to maximize revenue

---

## 🧾 Dataset Summary

- **Source**: “The Bread Basket” online order log  
- **Duration**: 30th October 2016 to 9th April 2017  
- **Records**: 20,507 rows, ~9,000 unique transactions  
- **Columns**:  
  - `Transaction` – unique order ID  
  - `Item` – product name  
  - `date_time` – timestamp of purchase  
  - + Derived features like `Day Name`, `Hour`, `Month`, `period_day`, `weekday_weekend`

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn) – for cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA  
- **Excel** – for PivotTables, quick summaries, and visual prototypes  
- **Power BI** – to design an interactive dashboard with KPI cards, filters, and visual storytelling

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Top Product**: Coffee was the most frequently purchased item  
- **Peak Time**: Sales spiked during **midday** and **morning** hours  
- **Weekend Effect**: Saturdays and Sundays consistently outperformed weekdays
